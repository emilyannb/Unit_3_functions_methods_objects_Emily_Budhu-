    <li>1. Calling a function means executing all of the statments between the curly brackets with just one line of code. The code is what calls the function.</li>
    <li>2. When declaring functions, you give it parameters. The items inside of the parentheses are parameters. Inside of the functions, parameters act like variables.</li>
    <li>3. The values in functions have a name called arguments. </li>
    <li>4. Parameters are what goes into the parentheses, as variables, for the function that was declared. For example, getArea(3,5); the parameters are 3 and 5. Arguments are values in the code of a function that is being called. For example, wallWidth = 3; wallHeight= 5; getArea(wallWidth, wallHeight);</li>
  </ul>
